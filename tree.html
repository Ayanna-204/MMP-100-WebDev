    <p>Upon reaching the ancient oak tree as the sun dips below the horizon, you are greeted by a wise owl.<p>
        <p>The owl delivers another letter and a map, unveiling two distinct paths.<p>
            <p>The second letter have one of the owls feathers attached to it and stats:<p>
<p>If at any point you wish to return home before the quest is done, simply take the owl feather and blow on it three times. You will wake up in you bed with no true memories of the adventure. It will have all felt like a dream.
