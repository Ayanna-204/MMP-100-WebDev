    <p>You try waking the dragon.

        "Excuse me dragon." You yell so that the dragon can hear you.  </p>
<p>The dragon stirs awake causing some of the gold to fall of the pile. 

    "Who dares to wake the Great Dragon Killa" The Dragon groans, her strong voice shaking the cave.  </p>
    <p>"I do." You day. " But I didn't mean to be rude, I was sent on a quest and everything I have done so far has led me to this cave."</p>
    <p>
        "A quest, who sent you?" Killa asked, slowly climbing off her plie of riches.</P>
        <p>"I don't really know, I recieved a letter and there was an owl and-"</p>
        <p>"An owl." Killa cuts you off. " Of course it was them, love those guys. Every 200 years or so they send a human on a quest to this relm, very few make it as far as you do. Here are your choices: </p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="riches.html"> Take some tresure back home and be rich, but never be able to return.</a></li>
    <li><a href="travel.html"> The ability to come and go from this relm whenever you wish, but you can't take any of the treasure</a></li>
    <li><a href="return.html">Return Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="index.html">Start Over</a></li>
