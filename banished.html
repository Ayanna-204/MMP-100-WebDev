    <p>You wake up after hearing an owl outside your window. You feel like you've just awoken from a strange dream.  </p>
    <p>Suddenly your mind is filled with images of an angry dragon snapping her shrp teeth at you, causing your heart to race. </p>
    <p>You know then that it was not a dream everything your thinking of right now was real and there is nothing you can do about it. </p>
